# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub Issue to report the vulnerability.**

Instead please use this [Report a vulnerability][report] link. Provide a helpful title, detailed
description of the vulnerability and an exploit proof-of-concept. Speculative submissions without
proof-of-concept will be closed with no further consideration.

If you haven't done so already, please [**enable two-factor auth**][gh-2fa] in your GitHub account.

Expect a response as fast as possible in the advisory, typically within 72 hours.
